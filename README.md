 ## An Ultra-Fast Neural Network Proxy for Photonic Crystal Fiber Design.

### 1. Overview
This repository provides a machine-learning-based surrogate model for characterizing Specialty Optical Fibers. By training on high-fidelity FEM data, the engine predicts the Complex Effective Index ($n_{eff}$) and Dispersion ($D$) without the need for intensive Maxwell solvers.
