This is where the magic happens. To move from a static model to a true "Data Factory," you need a script that bridges the gap between the high-fidelity physics of simulation software and the data-hungry nature of Machine Learning.

In the industry, we call this Orchestration. Instead of a researcher clicking "Run" five times a day, we build a pipeline that treats the simulation software as a "black box" function.

The Strategy: Automated Data Generation Pipeline (ADGP)
For this script, I’ll use the Lumerical API (lumapi) as the primary example, as it is the industry standard for photonics. However, the logic is identical for COMSOL (using the mph Python library).

# The Orchestrator Script

### The Technical Pitch: Why "Latin Hypercube Sampling" (LHS)?
When pitching this to an industrial lead, mention LHS.

. The Problem: A standard "Grid Sweep" (e.g., 10 wavelengths × 10 pitches) creates redundant data points where only one variable changes.

. The Solution: LHS ensures that no two samples share the same value for any variable. This provides a much "richer" dataset for the Neural Network to     learn the underlying physics of the Full-Vectorial Helmholtz Equation with fewer total simulations, saving hours of license-time on expensive software.

### Industrial Productization Checklist
1. config.yaml: To allow users to change simulation ranges without touching the Python code.
2. logger.py: To track "failed" simulations (e.g., where the mode didn't converge) so they don't corrupt the training data.
3. A "Model Card": A document explaining the accuracy limits of the AI proxy (e.g., "Accurate within $\pm 0.001$ for $n_{eff}$ in the C-band").
